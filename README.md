                                                     MACHINE LEARNING - WINE QUALITY CHECKING


                                                            
In the heart of the project, I implemented a Random Forest Classifier, a powerful Machine Learning algorithm, to predict wine quality. This meticulously crafted model showcased its accuracy through diligent tuning and thoughtful feature selection. As a result, I achieved an exceptional accuracy rate of 92.81%.

In summary, my project encompassed a holistic approach to wine quality assessment, covering data quality checks, extensive data processing, insightful visualizations, and crucial correlation analysis. The culmination of these efforts resulted in the development of a high-performing predictive model, exemplifying my skills in data analysis, Machine Learning, and project execution.
